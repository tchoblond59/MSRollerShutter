# MSRollerShutter

This is based on [scalz](https://github.com/scalz/MySensors-HW/tree/development/RollerShutterNode) work.
This is the software of the hardware node. You can find the front end code for [LaraHome](https://github.com/tchoblond59/LaraHome) -> [here](https://github.com/tchoblond59/SSRollerShutter)

For the moment you have to calibrate your node by manually trigger the end stop.
It will store the travel time down and up. Then you can set the position in percent.
Your shutter has to be closed when you launch calibration
